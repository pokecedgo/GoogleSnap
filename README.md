Drop personalized notes and markers onto your map in real time!


A personal side project I did revolving the use of the Apple Map API (I know, contradictory to the app name!) where a user can track their location in real time but with unique features such as dropping customizable "notes" onto the map and other markers which saves onto the map (**firebase**). Users can customize and delete said markers aswell along with a full user authentication / account deletion system.
